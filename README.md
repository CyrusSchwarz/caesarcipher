A simple proof of concept implementation of the Caesar cipher in java

Current limitations include: 

Being unable to handle spaces
Can't handle non-alphabet characters

I highly encourage you to edit this and make this better. I don't care what people do with this, but i'd appreciate it if the comments up top are left as is.
